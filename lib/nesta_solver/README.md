NESTA
==============

This solver is adapted from [NESTA](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/nesta/).

NESTA is a fast and robust first-order method than solves basis-pursuit problems and a large number of extensions (including tv-denoising). It is described in the paper NESTA: A Fast and Accurate First-order Method for Sparse Recovery (technical report, April 2009, California Institute of Technology) by Jérôme Bobin, Stephen Becker, and Emmanuel Candès. A journal version appears in SIAM J Imaging Sciences 4(1) 2011.
